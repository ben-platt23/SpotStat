        <h3>About Me</h3> Hello! My name is Ben Platt, and I am the engineer who created this website. I've lived in Maryland my whole life,
        and I currently reside in Annapolis. Right now, I'm a student at Frostburg State University, pursing my Master of Science in Applied Computer
        Science. I'll graduate with this degree in August of 2023. My hobbies include playing videogames with my friends, excerising, and hanging out with my 
        dog.

        <h3>My background</h3> I have a Bachelors of Science in Physics from St. Mary's College of Maryland. I am pursuing my Master of Science in Applied Computer
        Science at Frostburg State University, with a planned graduation of August 18th, 2023. Through my academics and internships, I've gained experience at every 
        end of the software development life cycle, both at the front-end and back-end. After graduation, I plan to start my career as a software engineer. 
        My interests lie in full stack or backend focused engineering.

            <h3>Why This Website?</h3> This website was created for a semester-long project in a web development course. I chose to use Spotify's 
            free API because I personally use Spotify for ~32,000 minutes every year (according to the end of year wrapped). I wanted to combine my interests 
            in full stack web development with my interest in seeing the statistics of my listening habits over time. I also love listening to the yearly "wrapped"
            playlists and wanted to be able to create my own on-demand.
